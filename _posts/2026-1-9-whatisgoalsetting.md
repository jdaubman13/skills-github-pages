### Today’s focus is goal setting—specifically goals that support your career, personal, and educational growth. Whether you want to improve your grades, explore a future career path, build better habits, or work toward something meaningful outside of school, having a clear goal can help turn your ideas into action.
One helpful way to set strong goals is by making them S.M.A.R.T.:
Specific – What exactly do you want to accomplish?
Measurable – How will you know you’re making progress?
Achievable – Is this goal realistic for you right now?
Relevant – Why does this goal matter to you?
Time-bound – When do you want to accomplish it?
